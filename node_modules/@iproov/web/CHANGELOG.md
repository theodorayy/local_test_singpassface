## 20.07.2020 2.2.1

## Fixed

- Handheld devices are able to take advantage of low FPS mode correctly
- Camera permission checks are now correctly performed on Firefox Android

## 22.06.2020 2.2.0

## Removed

- h3 and div tag support from slots without `.iproov-lang-heading` and `.iproov-lang-term` classes

## 22.06.2020 2.1.1

## Fixed

## 22.05.2020 2.1.0

## Fixed

- Kiosk mode: face centering on the y-axis has been correctly aligned.
- Kiosk mode: custom logo positioning has been fixed.
- Product performance: timing issues when starting in landscape causing occasional errors have been resolved.
- Product performance: issues where iMacs were unable to obtain a camera feed have been resolved.
- Native bridge: In Native Bridge mode, the support checker would return unsupported which is not always the case.
- CJS/ESM/UMD: Support has been ensured as per the docs. Previously imports would not work correctly.

## Changed

- The `base_url` option now requires a URL using `https://`; the deprecated functionality of prepending the secure protocol has been removed.
- Native bridge mode has been radically overhauled to make native integration possible with one line of code in a single location.
  - Web automatically detects this simple, one-line Native Bridge integration and switches to Native Bridge mode if applicable.
  - Breaking change: `prefer_app` has been removed in favour of this automatic integration.
  - Breaking change: `prefer_app_options` has been renamed to `native_sdk_options`
  - Breaking change: Native bridge mode now requires the following SDK minimum versions:
    - iOS SDK 7.5.0
    - Android SDK 5.3.0 (to be released and confirmed - if you urgently require this feature please get in touch: support@iproov.com)
- Improved error handling around fetching and loading external assets to help debug integration issues easier
- Improved error handling with cameras

## Added

- Added the capability for `sdk_unsupported` errors to be gracefully displayed to users, should a particular version of the Web SDK remain in production past its EOL.
- Added capability to provide early deprecation warnings to integrator developers via the console.

## 01.05.2020 2.0.6

## Fixed

## Fixed

- Scanning running twice if double clicking

## Changed

- Disabled vibration in Firefox due to permissions issue

## 20.04.2020 2.0.4

## Fixed

- Zooming in Chrome no longer causes a distorted view of the alignment phase
- WebGL initiation now performs less layout thrashing when adjusting screen resolution and entering into full screen

## Changed

- Face detector performance logging has been tweaked to use aggregates rather than bombarding the log stream

## 17.04.2020 2.0.3

## Fixed

- Invalidate events in from native bridge in iOS are now correctly proxied back to the Web SDK.

## 16.04.2020 2.0.2

## Fixed

- When using a custom slot for the button in native bridge mode, the app would fail to start
- Fix custom logo position in SVG

## 15.04.2020 2.0.0

## Added

- Face detector changed to Blazeface
- Standalone support checker component
- Assets have been moved to cdn.iproov.app for better load speed

## Fixed

- Timing regularity restored
- We now wait for WASM modules to fully load before interacting with them (stops crashing)
- SVG repositioning has been tweaked to remove jank
- Video feeds that change resolution, particularly on iMacs, no longer cause face alignment issues
- Bundle size has been reduced as part of an ongoing initiative to reduce page load weight
- King Kong has been tamed üçå

## Changed

- `@iproov/html5` is now the iProov Web SDK, and so has been renamed to `@iproov/web`
- Class names are now used to identify language text elements rather than blanket tags
- The rotate animation has been switched from lottie to gif (saves bundle size)
- Support is now checked by the support checker component rather than a whitelist of browsers and devices
- Alignment feedback frequency has been tweaked to work better with a new face detector in a future release
- Face detection lifecycle has been tidied to facilitate a new face detector in a future release
- PicoJS's face detector memory allocation and maxFaces have been reduced for performance on lower end/swapping devices
- Various telemetry improvements around face detection: accuracy, reduction in performance cost, etc

## Removed

- Option `screen_brightness` removed; due to lossless encoding and improved adaptive screen brightness, it is no longer needed. Removing it saves around 300kB from the bundle.

## Deprecated

- The screen_brightness animations and usage in older clients have been deprecated and will be removed in a later release.
- Loading assets from the iproov.app domain have been deprecated in favour of using the CDN.

## 03.04.2020 2.0.0-beta-5.4.5

## Changed

- Face alignment envelopes have been tweaked to improve user experience.
- The ability to set alignment envelopes from your service provider has been added.

## Added

- If no face is found by the face finder for 50% of the time, we time out after 30 seconds. This is configurable from your service provider.

## 01.04.2020 2.0.0-beta-5.4.4

## Fixed

- Preventative measures added to ensure screen flashing _never_ violates safe parameters for photosensitive epilepsy.
- Measures added to partially mitigate crashing when started too quickly.

## 25.03.2020 2.0.0-beta-5.4.2

## Fixed

- `show_countdown` option fixed in default mode, was previously causing `streaming_error`

## 19.03.2020 2.0.0-beta-5.4.1

## Fixed

- `show_countdown` option respected when in `kiosk_mode`
- `custom_title` and `custom_logo` support added to kiosk mode

## 12.03.2020 2.0.0-beta-5.4

## Fixed

- Encoding corrupt images resulted in facial features going missing, causing liveness to fail.
- Face cropping logic improved to handle extremes in the camera's field of view without clipping.
- Huge memory management improvements to reduce device load.
- Fixed a missing missing `asset_url` domain prefix when loading Pico.
- Scaling issues relating to face alignment on non-retina iOS devices have been resolved (`devicePixelRatio` interpretation)
- Various moves to align the HTML5 web SDK with the iOS and Android SDKs which make performance analysis easier, resulting in even better service for our customers!

## Added

- Kiosk mode has landed in alpha, with a new and improved UI design for this particular mode.
- Ability to configure face finder and face alignment envelope from a service provider.
- New language term `error_exited_native_bridge`, used when exiting a native SDK using the `prefer_app` setting.

## Changed
